Microstates of the Gaussian free field on the discrete 3-torus of side length N. These are represented as NxNxN np arrays, with coordinate interpreted as periodic mod N.

The first layer of subdirectories corresponds to how the weights (conductivities, spring constants, however we choose to interpret them) in the GFF hamiltonian were chosen. "Uniform" refers to constant unit weights. "Linear" refers to weights chosen uniformly at random from the interval [0.0, 2.0].

The next layer of subdirectories gives the value of N.
